# `gha-honeymarker` Action

![release](/assets/honeymarker.gif)

This GitHub Action adds a marker from your deploy workflows using [Honeycomb's marker tool][honeymarker]. It annotates the timeline with a marker and optional metadata from the workflow and will always send a marker for the deploy, even if the deploy failed.

`gha-honeymarker` should be added after a deploy indicating a successful change or otherwise. Every job will create a separate marker.

⚠️ Limitations:

- Only works on Linux hosts.
- If downloading honeymarker fails or if running honeymarker fails (i.e. a bug in honeymarker), the entire job will fail.
